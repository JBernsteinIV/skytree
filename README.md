# Skytree

I wanted some "name" to make this project and I was thinking about the word 'tower' but I didn't want to conflate my random project with Ansible Tower.
I came across the 'Tokyo Skytree' which is the tallest tower in Japan.
Anyways that's the explanation for the project name. I just needed something to name a folder! Wow! Super --lame-- exciting!
